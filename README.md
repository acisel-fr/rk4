Description
-----------

The program RK4 (*rk4.nls*) is a library for the simulation software NetLogo [1]. This library is performing an iterative method for the approximation of solutions of ordinary differential equations: the Runge-Kutta 4th Order Method [2]. This library works with any number of equations and any number of variables. It is delivered with a demonstration (*rk4.nlogo*) showing the Butterfly attractor [3, 4] studied by Edward Lorenz.
